CMC for PHP skeleton
--------------------
This repository contains the skeleton for starting a new application using CMC For PHP framework.
The skeleton includes the compressed version of the CMC for PHP framework and the corresponding javascript component for jQuery.

This project is designed to work by just copying it into a PHP/Apache environment.
See live skeleton result:
http://cmc.calmarsoft.com/runtime/cmc-skel

It also shows a classic layout for a project using the framework.


Documentation
-------------

This skeleton DOES NOT relect all possible features of the CMC For PHP framework. We have to dig a little in the documentation for that.
More consistent project sample will come up ASAP!
